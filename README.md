Case Study:

You're walking up the empire state building and you're playing a game with a friend. For one hundred times , you throw a dice. If it's 1 or 2 you'll go one step down. If it's 3, 4 or 5 you'll go one step up. If you throw a 6, you'll throw a dice again and will walk the resulting number of eyes up. Of course you can not go lower than step number 0. And also, you admit that you're a bit clumsy and have a chance of 0.1% of falling down the stairs when you make a move.

Falling down means that you have to start again from step 0. With all of this, you bet with your friend that you'll reach 60 steps high.

What is the chance that you will win this bet??
